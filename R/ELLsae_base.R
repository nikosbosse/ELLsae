#'@title ellsae
#'@description The function \code{ellsae} implements the "ELL-method" method for
#'  small area estimation by Elbers, C., Lanjouw, J. O. and Lanjouw, P (2003)
#'  used to impute a missing variable from a smaller survey dataset into a
#'  census. The imputation is based on a linear model and bootstrap samples
#'
#'@param model a model that describes the relationship between the response and
#'  the explanatory variables. Input must be a linear model that can be
#'  processed by \code{lm()}
#'@param weights=NULL weights than can be used for fitting the model
#'@param survey data.table with the response variable of interest included. Will
#'  be used to estimate the linear model. Input will be coerced to a data.table
#'@param census data.table where the variable of interest is missing and shall
#'  be imputed
#'@param location_survey string with the name of the variable in the survey data
#'  set that contains information about the cluster (= location) of an
#'  observation
#'@param n_boot integer indicating the size of the bootstrap sample
#'@param seed integer, seed can be set to obtain reproducible results
#'@param welfare.function function that transforms the bootstrapped variable of
#'  interested to obtain some welfare estimate
#'@param transfy function to transform the response y in the model
#'@param transfy_inv inverse function of \code{transfy} for back-transformation
#'@param output character string or character vector. Either "default", "all",
#'  or a vector with one or more of the following elements: c("summary",
#'  "yboot", "model_fit", "bootsample", "survey", "census")
#'@param cores either a string, "auto", or an integer value indicating the
#'  number of cores to be used for the estimation.
#'@param quantiles vector of requested quantiles for the \code{summaryboot}
#'  output defined as decimals between 0 and 1.
#'@param clustermeans character vector with names of variables present in both
#'  data sets. The mean of those variables in the census will be computed by
#'  location and added to the survey data set before estimation of the linear
#'  model. This may enhance precision of the estimates
#'@param location_census string with the name of the variable in the survey data
#'  set that contains information about the cluster (= location) of an
#'  observation. Only needed if \code{clustermeans} are computed.
#'@param save_boot logical value. TRUE saves the bootstrap sample as
#'  BootstrapSampleELLsae-DATE.csv in the current working direktory.
#'
#'@details The function takes the survey data set and uses the argument
#'  \code{model} to estimate a linear model of the type \code{lm()}. In case the
#'  argument \code{clustermeans} is specified, means from the census data for
#'  the given variables are calculated and merged with the survey data by
#'  cluster locations. These new explanatory variables are also used for the
#'  estimation of the linear model. Rows with NA's are omitted from the
#'  computation.
#'
#'  The user may choose to transform the response variable using a function,
#'  \code{transfy}, previous to estimating the model. This function will be
#'  directly applied to the entire vector of the response variable, i.e.
#'  \code{transfy(response)}. This means the specified function needs to be able
#'  to take a vector as input. For transformations like \code{log}, \code{exp},
#'  \code{sqrt} this will just yield an element-wise transformation. For more
#'  complex transformation, you may want to use \code{\link{sapply}} inside your
#'  function, to ensure element-wise transformation. This also applies to
#'  \code{transfy_inv}, and \code{welfare.function} which need to be able to
#'  take a matrix as input. In many cases a transformation like \code{transfy}
#'  could also be achieved by altering the specified model appropriately, but
#'  using \code{transfy} and \code{transfy_inv} is the recommended usage.
#'
#'
#'  From the regression, location effects are calculated as the mean by location
#'  of the regression residuals. Individual random error terms are then obtained
#'  as the difference between the regression residuals and the location effects.
#'  The bootstrapped response variables are generated using three sources of
#'  randomness. The betas obtained from \code{lm()} are replaced by draws from a
#'  multivariate normal distribution. In addition random location effects and
#'  residuals are drawn with replacement. Internally the sample is a matrix,
#'  \code{bootstrap}, with the rows corresponding to bootstrap samples for one
#'  individual observation in the census data set.
#'
#'  If \code{transfy_inv} was specified, the bootstrap sample is transformed
#'  back. This function will be directly applied to the matrix of bootstrap
#'  samples, i.e. \code{transfy_inv(bootstrap)}.
#'
#'  If a welfare function was specified it will be used to transform the
#'  bootstrap sample. It will be diretly applied to the matrix of bootstrap
#'  samples, i.e. \code{welfare.function(bootstrap)}. Bootstrap samples that
#'  belong to one observation are arranged row-wise.
#'
#'  \code{cores} specifies the number of cores to use for the calculation. As
#'  parallelization is done in C++ and incurs little overhead this should in
#'  most cases be left to "auto".
#'
#'  To obtain reproducicble results, a \code{seed} can be specified. Simply
#'  running \code{set.seed()} in R does not work. Providing a seed will not
#'  permanently alter the seed in R.
#'
#'@return \code{ellsae} returns a list. By default, this list included a matrix
#'  with basic summary statistics as specified in \code{quantiles}, a vector
#'  with the means of the bootstrap samples for every observation, and the
#'  \code{lm}-object obtained from the linear model estimation. In addition, the
#'  user can request the full matrix of bootstrap samples, and an updated
#'  data.table of the survey and census data set with residuals and location
#'  effects and clustermeans added.
#'
#'
#'@seealso If issues with memory allocation occur one, can also use
#'  \code{\link[ELLsae:ellsae_big]{ellsae_big}} instead.Other small area
#'  estimation methods can also be found in the package
#'\code{sae}.
