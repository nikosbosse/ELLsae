#' ELLsae: A package for small area estimation
#' @section ELLsae functions:
#' Contains two functions one for normal use cases called 
#' \code{\link[ELLsae:ellsae]{ellsae}} and a 
#' second one called \code{\link[ELLsae:ellsae_big]{ellsae_big}} 
#' that can be used if RAM consumption 
#' becomes an issue but which is slower that the basic version.
#' @description A method for small area estimation.
#' @details  The method for small area estimation added by this package is 
#' largely based on an approach developed 
#' by C. Elbers, J. Lanjouw and P. Lanjouw (2003). It can be used to impute a 
#' missing variable 
#' from a smaller survey dataset into a census. The imputation is based on a 
#' linear model and bootstrap samples from a normal distribution. As of now the
#'  correction for heteroscedasticity 
#' is left omitted. +
