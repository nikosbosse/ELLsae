The method for small area estimation added by this package is 
  largely based on an approach developed 
  by C. Elbers, J. Lanjouw and P. Lanjouw (2003). It can be used to impute a 
  missing variable 
  from a smaller survey dataset into a census. The imputation is based on a 
  linear model and bootstrap samples from a normal distribution. As of now the 
  correction for heteroscedasticity is left omitted.
