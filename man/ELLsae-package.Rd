\title{ELLsae: A package for small area estimation}
\description{
A method for small area estimation.
}
\details{
The method for small area estimation added by this package is 
largely based on an approach developed 
by C. Elbers, J. Lanjouw and P. Lanjouw (2003). It can be used to impute a 
missing variable 
from a smaller survey dataset into a census. The imputation is based on a 
linear model and bootstrap samples from a normal distribution. As of now the
 correction for heteroscedasticity 
is left omitted. +
}
\section{ELLsae functions}{

Contains two functions one for normal use cases called 
\code{\link[ELLsae:ellsae]{ellsae}} and a 
second one called \code{\link[ELLsae:ellsae_big]{ellsae_big}} 
that can be used if RAM consumption 
becomes an issue but which is slower that the basic version.
